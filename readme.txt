XSS-Me
======
XSS-Me is a part of the Security Compass Exploit-Me series of tools.  XSS-Me is
designed to aid in the detection of Cross-Site scripting vulnerabilities.  The
tool is a Firefox extenstion that will execute specific attack strings against
forms on your website.


Limitations
-----------
Currently XSS-Me is focused on detecting reflected Cross-Site scripting
attacks.  While we have plans to implement the detection of stored Cross-Site
scripting we are currently focusing on the speed and accuracy of the reflected
portions of the tool.
